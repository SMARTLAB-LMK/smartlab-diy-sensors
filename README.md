# SMARTLAB DIY SENSORS

The SMARTLAB (Smart Building Living Lab) project adopts a living lab approach, to work directly with end users across a range of use cases, to examine financial and technical barriers to the deployment of smart technologies in Irelandâ€™s buildings.

This is a repository for code and design files to enable you to develop your own smart sensors and take part in the DIY workshops of SMARTLAB.
